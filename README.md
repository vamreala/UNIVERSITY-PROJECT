# UNIVERSIYY-PROJECT CySERA
I declare that this project is my own work and has not previously been submitted for assessment in any academic institution in any capacity. I did my own research and in cases where I used research from other scholars, I have acknowledged all the materials and sources in its preparation. 

# Abstract
Nowadays users without cybersecurity knowledge are considered to be the weakest link in the security chain, due to their insecure behaviour and their lack of awareness. However, this does not mean that users who have the knowledge behave differently from those without.   Institutions are therefore required to encourage their shareholders and customers on the importance of cybersecurity education. There is need for users to effectively evaluate their skills on cybersecurity. The aim of this study is to develop the Cybersecurity Skill Evaluation and Role Assessment (CySERA) system that will evaluate cybersecurity skills and gauge users weakness and strengths. 

The system follows a three-tier architecture. Presentation layer (front-end) that handles user interaction through a web-based interface. Application layer (back-end) that processes data and performs skill evaluations. Data layer that manages storage of user data, questions, and evaluation results. 
The architecture ensures scalability, modularity and security, accommodating multiple user roles and ensuring efficient performance.
